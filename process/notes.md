- cloudflare tunnel already at dev.trusthuman.io and pointing at localhost:3000 because trpc routes is hosted together with nextjs app
- remove camera mode toggle - just use auto capture single image cause that's more limited invasion
- there is a concern that having the extension take your webcam picture might be spooky - but we absolutely want to use the webcam capture (not screenshot) as a verification method. how do we make this as friendly as possible and not spooky?

- is the following feature already covered in the plan? when users with extension installed visit other users who have trusthuman profile - their x/linkedin personal page shows their badge (like trustpilot badge)

- for mvp launchh - we want 2 types of activities covered: reply and post - is this already in the plan?
