# TribeKit Messenger Cloud Sync: PRD and Architecture (V1 Prototype)

## 1. Context and Goals

TribeKit will provide cloud-synced analytics and conversations for Facebook Messenger. Users authenticate to the web UI via Clerk. A downloadable desktop companion app (a branded fork of `mautrix/manager`) handles the one-time Messenger login by talking directly to the bridge provisioning API. Once the desktop flow succeeds, a persistent Hono service on AWS EC2 keeps ingesting Matrix events from the self-hosted Synapse + `mautrix-meta` bridge, stores data in Supabase (PostgreSQL via Prisma), and delivers continuously refreshed conversations to a Next.js UI.

- In-scope (V1):
  - Desktop companion app for Messenger authentication and bridge provisioning
  - Single shared `mautrix-meta` bridge instance on EC2
  - Self-hosted Synapse + Postgres + Nginx on one EC2 instance (Docker Compose)
  - Dedicated Hono service on EC2 for sync/backfill/ingestion
  - Supabase/Prisma persistence; Clerk auth on web; tRPC API; Next.js UI
  - Continuous backfill and real-time updates rendered in the web app
  - Simple onboarding to link a desktop Matrix account with the Clerk web account

- Out-of-scope (V1):
  - Per-user bridge instances or sharded IP egress
  - Non-Messenger platforms
  - Multi-region, high availability
  - GDPR workflows and full compliance features
  - Stripe/billing flows
  - Mobile clients

## 1.5 Execution Brief

### Phase 1-4: Foundation (Database, Desktop App, UI, Hono Service)
**What happens:** Set up Prisma models, fork desktop companion, scaffold Next.js UI with mock data, bootstrap Hono service with Clerk auth.

**Test:** Database migrations pass, desktop app builds, UI shows mock conversations, Hono `/healthz` returns ok.

### Phase 5: Infrastructure (EC2)
**What happens:** Deploy Synapse + mautrix-meta + Nginx on EC2, configure TLS, deploy Hono with PM2.

**Test:** `https://matrix.buildstuffs.io` responds, `https://hono.buildstuffs.io/healthz` returns db/clerk ok.

### Phase 6: Provisioning Flow
**What happens:** Desktop app authenticates with Matrix/Messenger, calls Hono callback, web UI links Matrix account.

**Test:** User can link Matrix account, database shows `CONNECTED` status.

### Phase 7: Sync Worker + Persistence
**What happens:** Matrix sync worker ingests messages, persists to Supabase, backfills historical messages.

**Test:** Real messages appear in database, Next.js UI shows actual conversations instead of mock data.

### Phase 8-11: Polish (WebSockets, Real-time UI, Backfill, Hardening)
**What happens:** Add WebSocket server for live updates, wire UI to real data, implement backfill jobs, security hardening.

**Test:** Messages appear in UI within seconds, backfill loads 30 days history, no security vulnerabilities.

### Expected Outcome
- Users authenticate via desktop companion
- Messenger conversations sync to Supabase in real-time
- Web UI displays actual Messenger history
- Infrastructure runs on single EC2 (~$20/month)

## 2. Non-Goals and Constraints

- Optimize for prototype speed and simplicity (accept single point of failure)
- Single egress IP acceptable initially; revisit if rate-limited
- Target “tens of users” to validate feasibility
- Clerk is the sole auth provider (web and extension)

## 3. Architecture Decisions (Final)

1. Hosting: Single EC2 instance with Docker Compose

- Services: Synapse, Postgres, `mautrix-meta`, Nginx (TLS termination)
- Rationale: Fastest to ship, lowest ops for V1

2. Bridge Tenancy: Single shared `mautrix-meta` instance

- Rationale: Supported model; simplest operations
- Implication: Cross-user impact on rate-limits and outages

3. Backend Runtime: Dedicated Hono service on EC2

- Node 22, managed by PM2 or systemd, behind Nginx (WS upgrade enabled)
- Rationale: Long-lived sync worker and WebSockets need a persistent runtime

4. Ingestion Identity: Appservice bot

- Rationale: Single token, simplified access to all bridged rooms

5. Real-time Delivery: WebSockets from Hono to Next.js

- Rationale: Full-duplex, flexible for future features

6. Backfill Strategy: Explicit Matrix `/messages` pagination per room after provisioning

- Rationale: Deterministic, controllable limits and retries

7. Desktop Provisioning: Electron companion app (`mautrix-manager` fork)

- Provides guided Messenger login via bridge provisioning API
- Captures cookies/tokens securely within app and hands them to bridge on EC2
- Avoids Chrome extension maintenance and complex browser permissions

## 3.5 Architecture Clarification: Next.js + Hono Separation

### Why Separate Services?

TribeKit's existing Next.js app is deployed on Vercel (serverless), which cannot support:

- Long-running Matrix `/sync` loops (persistent connections)
- WebSocket servers with persistent user connections
- Background workers that run indefinitely

### Service Responsibilities

**Next.js on Vercel (Existing TribeKit App)**

- Clerk-authenticated web UI for conversations/analytics
- tRPC API for queries and mutations (messenger.conversations.list, etc.)
- Database reads via Prisma
- Provides UI for users to link their Matrix login (submit Matrix user ID/code)

**Hono Service on EC2 (New, Minimal)**

- Matrix sync worker (background loop maintaining `/sync` connection)
- WebSocket server (`/ws`) for real-time updates to UI
- Bridge provisioning endpoint (`POST /messenger/connect`)
- Event persistence to Supabase via Prisma
- WebSocket broadcast to connected clients

**Synapse + mautrix-meta on EC2**

- Matrix homeserver and Messenger bridge (as specified in Section 8)

### Communication Patterns

**Desktop Companion → Backend:**

1. User signs into Matrix and Messenger via the desktop app
2. Companion confirms provisioning success and POSTs bridge status + Matrix user ID to Hono (authenticated with manager API key)
3. Web UI (while user is logged in with Clerk) asks the user to paste/confirm the Matrix user ID, storing the mapping in `MessengerConnection`
4. After mapping is confirmed, no desktop presence is required; bridge keeps syncing 24/7

**Real-time Updates:**

1. Hono Matrix sync worker receives events from Synapse
2. Hono persists to Supabase
3. Hono broadcasts via WebSocket to Next.js UI clients
4. Next.js client components connect directly to Hono WS endpoint

**UI Data Queries:**

1. Next.js UI calls tRPC: `messenger.conversations.list()`
2. tRPC queries Supabase directly (Prisma) - no Hono involvement

### Benefits of This Architecture

- ✅ Keep existing TribeKit on Vercel (edge, CDN, auto-scaling)
- ✅ Use tRPC for 90% of API calls (familiar pattern)
- ✅ Hono only handles persistent connections (10% of logic)
- ✅ Clear separation: Next.js = user-facing, Hono = infrastructure
- ✅ Independent scaling and deployment
- ✅ Both services use same Prisma client, Clerk auth, Supabase

## 4. High-level Data Flow

```
User (Clerk) ──> Next.js UI (link Matrix ID)
          └─ download desktop companion
Desktop Companion ──> Matrix login ──> Messenger OAuth
                      └─ POST success to Hono (API key)
Hono + Bridge on EC2 ──> mautrix-meta ↔ Messenger ↔ Synapse
                        └─ Continuous Matrix /sync → Supabase (Prisma)
                        └─ Broadcast updates / expose APIs to web
Next.js UI ──> tRPC queries Supabase, renders conversations/messages
```

## 5. Security Posture

- Keep Messenger session artifacts inside the bridge/desktop flow; do not persist raw cookies in TribeKit services
- Restrict bridge provisioning API and Synapse admin endpoints to the EC2 private network/security groups
- Require a static manager API key (or future device tokens) for desktop companion → Hono calls; rotate key on redeploys
- Use Clerk for web UI access control; all database reads/writes initiated from Next.js remain Clerk-protected
- Maintain audit logs for provisioning callbacks, ingestion jobs, and broadcast operations
- Rotate secrets on redeploys; minimize retention of sensitive bridge metadata

## 6. Desktop Companion (mautrix-manager fork)

### Responsibilities

- Guide the user through Matrix homeserver login and Messenger OAuth/cookie capture
- Detect existing connections (`whoami`) and show status, relogin, logout options
- POST successful login metadata (Matrix user ID, bridge user ID, status) to Hono API using a static manager key
- Store Matrix credentials locally so the user can re-open the app to relogin if needed (optional for MVP)

### Onboarding Flow

1. User logs into Next.js web app with Clerk and downloads the desktop companion
2. Companion prompts for Matrix homeserver URL (default prefilled to `https://matrix.buildstuffs.io`)
3. User authenticates via Matrix username/password or SSO
4. Companion auto-discovers the Messenger bridge via `.well-known/matrix/mautrix`
5. User clicks “Connect Messenger”; the app opens the managed webview to complete OAuth/cookie capture
6. Upon success, the app shows “Connected” and POSTs bridge identifiers to Hono
7. Web UI asks the user to confirm or paste the Matrix user ID to link their Clerk account (MVP manual step)

### Future Enhancements

- Automatic Matrix account creation via Synapse admin API during onboarding
- Stronger auth between desktop app and Hono (device registration, signed payloads)
- Optional auto-refresh of tokens and background health checks

## 7. Backend (Hono) Endpoints and Workers

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/messenger/connect`
  - Auth: Clerk bearer token (from extension)
  - Body: encrypted Messenger auth payload (cookies + tokens + headers)
  - Action: upsert `MessengerConnection`, provision user via bridge provisioning API
  - Response: `{ status: 'pending' | 'connected', connectionId }`

- `GET /api/messenger/status`
  - Auth: Clerk bearer token (web)
  - Query: `connectionId`
  - Response: provisioning status and brief diagnostics

- `WS /ws`
  - Auth: Clerk token via initial query param or header verification
  - Channel: per-user; events for conversations/messages/connection

### Workers

- Sync loop: maintain Matrix `/sync` for the appservice bot, track joined rooms
- Backfill jobs: on new connection, paginate `/messages` backward per room to a limit
- Persistence: write to Supabase via Prisma; deduplicate via `matrixEventId`
- Broadcast: emit WebSocket events per user for updates

## 8. Bridge and Synapse Deployment (EC2, Docker Compose)

### Services

- `synapse`: Matrix homeserver
- `postgres`: DB for synapse
- `mautrix-meta`: Messenger bridge as appservice
- `nginx`: TLS termination and reverse proxy to synapse/bridge

### Appservice Registration

- Unique registration YAML for `mautrix-meta` loaded by Synapse
- Appservice bot auto-join all bridged rooms; ensure power levels/config allow auto-join

### TLS and DNS

- `matrix.yourdomain.com` → EC2 public IP; Let’s Encrypt via Nginx
- Expose Synapse client API over 443; restrict bridge management endpoints to private network

## 9. Database Schema (Prisma Overview)

```prisma
model MessengerConnection {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId       String   // Clerk user ID
  status       String   // 'pending' | 'connected' | 'error'
  bridgeUserId String?  // Matrix/bridge user identifier
  lastSyncAt   DateTime?
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Conversation {
  id            String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId        String
  matrixRoomId  String   @unique
  title         String?
  avatarUrl     String?
  isGroup       Boolean  @default(false)
  lastEventAt   DateTime?
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Participant {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  conversationId String
  externalId     String?  // FB/Messenger user/page ID (if available)
  displayName    String?
  avatarUrl      String?
}

model Message {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  conversationId String
  senderId       String?  // Participant.id or external
  matrixEventId  String   @unique
  body           String
  type           String   // m.room.message subtypes
  timestamp      DateTime
  editedAt       DateTime?
  reactionsJson  Json?
}

// Suggested indexes
// @@index([userId]) on Conversation
// @@index([conversationId, timestamp]) on Message
```

## 10. tRPC API Surface (Next.js app)

### Queries

- `conversation.list`: list conversations for the current user
- `message.list`: paginated messages for a conversation
- `connection.status`: return user’s MessengerConnection status

### Mutations

- `connection.initiate`: initiate provisioning (web-triggered optional)
- `connection.disconnect`: remove bridge mapping
- `backfill.trigger`: admin/ops-only to kick off backfill for a room

### Auth

- Protected procedures via Clerk (web) and Bearer (extension)

## 11. Real-time Event Model

### Event Types

- `connection.status` → `{ status, error?, connectionId }`
- `conversation.updated` → `{ conversation }`
- `message.created` → `{ conversationId, message }`
- `message.updated` → `{ conversationId, message }`

### Channel Strategy

- Per-user channel keyed by Clerk user ID; Hono validates token at connect-time

## 12. Phased Delivery Plan (Refined)

### Current Status (October 2025)

- ✅ Phase 1: Database + API foundation
- ✅ Phase 2: Desktop companion repo forked and builds locally
- ✅ Phase 3: Web UI scaffolding
- ✅ Phase 4: Hono service bootstrap
- ✅ Phase 5: EC2 infrastructure (Synapse + bridge + Hono) operational
- ✅ Phase 6: Provisioning Flow (desktop companion integration + mapping) **COMPLETED**
- 🚧 Phase 7: Sync Worker + Persistence (Matrix sync loop + event parsing)

**Immediate Next Steps**: Phase 7 (Matrix sync worker + message persistence)

### Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: January 2025

#### Database Schema Changes

Added four new Prisma models in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`:

1. **MessengerConnection**
   - Tracks user's bridge connection status (`PENDING | CONNECTED | ERROR | DISCONNECTED`)
   - Stores encrypted Messenger auth artifacts
   - Fields: `bridgeUserId`, `lastSyncAt`, `errorMessage`
   - Indexes: `userId`, `status`

2. **Conversation**
   - Represents Messenger chats/threads
   - Unique `matrixRoomId` links to Matrix bridge
   - Denormalized fields: `lastMessage`, `unreadCount` (for UI performance)
   - Fields: `title`, `avatarUrl`, `isGroup`, `lastEventAt`
   - Indexes: `userId`, `userId + lastEventAt`

3. **Participant**
   - People in conversations
   - Links to both external systems: `externalId` (Facebook), `matrixUserId`
   - Fields: `displayName`, `avatarUrl`
   - Unique constraint: `conversationId + externalId`

4. **Message**
   - Individual messages with full history
   - Unique `matrixEventId` for deduplication
   - Metadata JSON for reactions, edits, attachments
   - Fields: `body`, `type`, `timestamp`, `editedAt`
   - Indexes: `conversationId + timestamp`, `matrixEventId`

**Generated**:

- Prisma client with TypeScript types (node + edge)
- Zod validators for all models

#### tRPC API Router

Created `packages/api/src/router/messenger.ts` with the data access pattern for conversations/messages and connection bookkeeping. Mutations now expect linkage events coming from either the web UI or the desktop companion (no extension payloads).

**Queries:**

- `getConnectionStatus` - Get user's current Messenger connection
- `listConversations` - Paginated conversation list (cursor-based, includes participants)
- `getConversation` - Single conversation details
- `listMessages` - Paginated messages for a conversation (includes sender info)

**Mutations (currently used / planned):**

- `connection.linkMatrixAccount` (new) – record Matrix user ID for the signed-in Clerk user (MVP manual step)
- `connection.disconnect`
- `backfill.trigger`
- (Legacy) `connection.initiate` / `connect`: can be repurposed or deprecated once desktop flow lands

**Features:**

- Full cursor-based pagination
- Authorization checks (protectedProcedure via Clerk)
- Ownership validation
- TODO markers for Phase 6+ integration with desktop callbacks

**Registered** in `packages/api/src/router/root.ts` as `messenger` router.

**What works today:**

- Next.js components can render conversation/message lists using existing queries
- Database schema is ready for sync worker ingestion
- Clerk-protected APIs ensure users only see their own data

### Phase 2: Desktop Companion Bootstrap ✅ COMPLETED

- Fork of `mautrix/manager` cloned under `messenger-analytics/manager`
- Builds locally; ready for branding/integration tasks in Phase 6

### Phase 3: UI Scaffolding ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 3: UI Scaffolding ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: January 2025

#### Implementation Summary

Created complete client-side Messenger UI using tRPC React Query and shadcn/ui components.

**Routes Created**:

1. `/app/messenger/page.tsx` - Conversation list view
2. `/app/messenger/[conversationId]/page.tsx` - Conversation detail view

**Components Created**:

1. `_components/connection-status.tsx` - Status badge (PENDING/CONNECTED/ERROR/DISCONNECTED)
2. `_components/conversation-list-item.tsx` - List item with title, snippet, timestamp
3. `_components/message-bubble.tsx` - Message display with left/right layout

#### Features Implemented

**Data Fetching**:

- Uses `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query` with tRPC `queryOptions()`
- Queries: `getConnectionStatus`, `listConversations`, `getConversation`, `listMessages`
- Proper type safety throughout

**Mock Fallback System**:

- Shows mock data when database is empty
- Clear "Mock data (no data yet)" banner
- 3 mock conversations: General, Project A, Support
- 10 mock messages in conversation view
- Mock detection for conversation IDs starting with "mock-"
- Automatically switches to real data when available

**Pagination**:

- "Load more" button on conversation list (appears when `nextCursor` exists)
- "Load older" button on message view
- Cursor-based pagination with state management
- Disabled for mock conversations

**UI States**:

- Loading: Skeleton components from `@sassy/ui/skeleton`
- Error: Card with error message and Retry button
- Empty: Handled by mock fallback system
- Success: Clean list and detail views

**Navigation**:

- List → Detail via clickable conversation cards
- Detail → List via Back button
- Connection status badge on all pages

#### Technical Details

**Libraries Used**:

- `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching
- `@sassy/ui/*` for all UI components (Badge, Button, Card, Skeleton)
- Next.js App Router with client components
- tRPC React integration via `useTRPC()` hook

**Type Safety**:

- Full TypeScript throughout
- Proper Prisma type handling (Date vs string)
- No type assertions or `any` types

**Code Quality**:

- Zero linter errors
- Follows existing codebase patterns
- Proper import ordering
- RO-RO pattern where applicable

#### Files Modified/Created

```
apps/nextjs/src/app/messenger/
├── page.tsx (134 lines)
├── [conversationId]/

#### What's Functional Now

**Users can**:

- Navigate to `/messenger` and see mock conversations
- Click any conversation to view mock messages
- See connection status at all times
- Experience loading states and error handling
- Navigate back and forth between list and detail

**Ready for**:

- Phase 4-7: Once Hono service syncs real data, UI automatically switches from mock to live data
- Phase 8: WebSocket integration for real-time updates (components already structured for it)

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (Database + tRPC API) ✅ Complete

### Phase 4: Hono Service Bootstrap ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: January 2025

#### Package Structure

Created new package: `packages/messenger-service-hono` (`@sassy/messenger-service-hono`)

**Reserved for Future Phases**:

- `HONO_SERVICE_URL` - Used by Next.js/tRPC to call this service
- `BRIDGE_BASE_URL` - mautrix-meta bridge endpoint

**Validation Pattern**:

Environment variables are validated using `@t3-oss/env-core` for consistency with the Next.js app. This provides:

- Type-safe environment variable access
- Runtime validation with clear error messages
- `emptyStringAsUndefined` for cleaner validation
- `skipValidation` option for CI/Docker builds

#### Implemented Features

**1. Health Endpoint** (`GET /healthz`):

- Returns: `{ ok: true, db: "ok" | "down", clerk: "ok", dbError?: string }`
- Performs database health check via `db.$queryRaw`
- Includes error details when DB connection fails
- Public endpoint (no auth required)

**2. Clerk Authentication Middleware**:

- Protects all `/api/*` routes using `@hono/clerk-auth`
- Based on Clerk's official Hono middleware: https://clerk.com/changelog/2023-11-08
- Validates bearer tokens from extension and Next.js

**3. CORS Configuration**:

- Origins parsed from `HONO_CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Allows: `GET`, `POST`, `OPTIONS` methods
- Headers: `Authorization`, `Content-Type`

**4. Route Stubs** (Phase 6 preparation):

- `POST /api/messenger/connect` - Bridge provisioning stub (returns 202 Accepted)
- `GET /api/messenger/status` - Connection status stub

**5. WebSocket Path Reserved**:

- `GET /ws` - Returns 501 Not Implemented (Phase 8)

#### Scripts

```json
"dev": "pnpm with-env tsx src/server.ts"       // Local development
"build": "tsup src/server.ts --format esm --target node22"
"start": "pnpm with-env node dist/server.js"   // Production
"with-env": "dotenv -e ../../.env --"          // Environment loading
```

#### What's Functional

**Local Development**:

```bash
# Run from repo root
pnpm --filter @sassy/messenger-service-hono dev

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:4000/healthz
# Returns: {"ok":true,"db":"ok","clerk":"ok"}
```

**Authentication**:

- Protected endpoints require Clerk bearer token
- Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
- Returns 500 for invalid tokens

**Database Integration**:

- Prisma client imported directly from `@sassy/db` package (no wrapper)
- Connection pooling via Supabase
- Health checks validate database connectivity with error reporting

#### Deployment Notes (Future)

For EC2 deployment (Phase 5):

- Run with PM2 or systemd for process management
- Nginx reverse proxy with TLS termination
- Enable WebSocket upgrade in Nginx config for `/ws` path
- Set production environment variables
- Expose `HONO_SERVICE_URL` to Next.js for API calls

- README: Full documentation in package README.md

### Phase 5: Infrastructure (EC2) ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed
**Date Completed**: Oct 13, 2025
**Duration**: ~6 hours (with troubleshooting)

#### Overview

Deploy complete infrastructure on single EC2 instance:

- Matrix Synapse + Postgres + mautrix-meta (Docker Compose)
- Hono service (PM2)
- Nginx reverse proxy with TLS
- DNS configuration for buildstuffs.io

#### Architecture Decisions

**EC2 Specifications**:

- Instance Type: `t3.small` (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) - ~$15/month
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86_64)
- Storage: 30GB EBS (gp3)
- Region: us-east-1 (Virginia)

**Domain Setup** (`buildstuffs.io`):

- `matrix.buildstuffs.io` → Synapse (HTTPS)
- `hono.buildstuffs.io` → Hono service (HTTPS)
- Both point to EC2 public IP

**Services Layout**:

```
EC2 Instance (Public IP)
├── Nginx (Docker) - :443 public
│   ├── matrix.buildstuffs.com → Synapse:8008
│   └── hono.buildstuffs.com → Hono:4000
├── Synapse (Docker) - :8008 internal
├── Postgres (Docker) - :5432 internal
├── mautrix-meta (Docker) - :29319 internal
└── Hono Service (PM2) - :4000 internal
```

**Security Groups**:

- Port 22 (SSH): Your IP only
- Port 80 (HTTP): 0.0.0.0/0 (Let's Encrypt verification)
- Port 443 (HTTPS): 0.0.0.0/0 (public API access)
- All other ports: Internal only

**Network Flow**:

```
Chrome Extension → Next.js (local/Vercel) →
hono.buildstuffs.io:443 → Nginx → Hono:4000 →
Provisions bridge → mautrix-meta → Messenger API
                 ↓
            Synapse ← mautrix-meta (message sync)
                 ↓

```

#### DNS Records (Namecheap)

Add these A records:

- `matrix` → EC2 Public IP (98.81.220.48)
- `hono` → EC2 Public IP (98.81.220.48)

#### TLS Certificates (Let's Encrypt)

Certificates for:

- `matrix.buildstuffs.io`
- `hono.buildstuffs.io`

Auto-renewal via certbot cron (runs daily)

#### Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] EC2 instance accessible via SSH
- [ ] DNS resolves: `dig matrix.buildstuffs.io` returns EC2 IP
- [ ] DNS resolves: `dig hono.buildstuffs.io` returns EC2 IP
- [ ] Synapse health: `curl https://matrix.buildstuffs.io/_matrix/client/versions`
- [ ] Hono health: `curl https://hono.buildstuffs.io/healthz`
- [ ] TLS certificates valid (check in browser)
- [ ] Docker containers running: `docker ps`
- [ ] Hono PM2 process running: `pm2 status`
- [ ] Supabase connectivity from Hono
- [ ] Bridge logs show successful startup

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**DNS not propagating:**

- Wait 15-30 minutes
- Clear local DNS cache: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` (Mac)
- Test with: `nslookup matrix.buildstuffs.io 8.8.8.8`

**Synapse fails to start:**

- Check logs: `docker compose logs synapse`
- Verify database connection
- Check homeserver.yaml syntax

**Hono can't connect to database:**

- Verify Supabase allows connections from EC2 IP
- Check DATABASE_URL format
- Test with: `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"`

**TLS certificate generation fails:**

- Verify DNS is fully propagated
- Check port 80 is accessible (security group)
- Try manual mode: `certbot certonly --manual`

**Bridge not connecting to Messenger:**

- Check captured auth artifacts are valid
- Verify fb_dtsg, cookies are present
- Check bridge logs: `docker compose logs mautrix-meta`

#### Security Notes

**Secrets Management:**

- Never commit `.env.production` to git
- Rotate Synapse registration shared secret after setup
- Use strong Postgres password (generated)
- Keep SSH key private

**Access Control:**

- SSH only from your IP (security group)
- No direct database access (only via app)
- Bridge admin API not exposed publicly
- Synapse admin API not exposed publicly

**Monitoring (Future):**

- Set up CloudWatch alarms (CPU, memory, disk)
- Configure PM2 monitoring
- Add health check cron jobs
- Log aggregation (CloudWatch Logs)

#### Cost Estimate

**AWS Costs** (monthly):

- EC2 t3.small: ~$15
- EBS 30GB: ~$3
- Data transfer: ~$1-5 (depends on usage)
- **Total: ~$20-25/month**

**Other Services** (already have):

- Supabase: Free tier (sufficient for MVP)
- Domain: Already owned
- Let's Encrypt: Free

#### Implementation Notes & Lessons Learned

**Date**: Oct 13, 2025

**Actual EC2 Configuration:**

- **Instance ID**: `i-03dda90191ef0d4fe`
- **Public IP**: `98.81.220.48`
- **Domains**: `matrix.buildstuffs.io`, `hono.buildstuffs.io`
- **SSH Key**: `~/.ssh/aws-keys/tribekit-messenger.pem`
- **Region**: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)

**Key Decisions & Workarounds:**

1. **Monorepo Deployment Pattern**
   - **Decision**: Cloned entire monorepo to EC2 instead of deploying only Hono package
   - **Reason**: Hono depends on workspace packages (`@sassy/db`, `@sassy/validators`) with Prisma client
   - **Benefit**: Simplifies dependency management; workspace packages resolve correctly
   - **Future**: Consider Docker image with pruned dependencies for production

2. **Hono Build Issues**
   - **Problem**: `tsup` build fails with DTS error despite `--dts false` flag
   - **Workaround**: Run Hono via PM2 with `tsx` (JIT compilation) instead of building
   - **Command**: `pm2 start --name hono "pnpm with-env tsx src/server.ts"`
   - **Impact**: No performance impact for MVP; works reliably
   - **Future**: Fix tsup config or switch to Docker for production

3. **Bridge Registration Generation**
   - **Problem**: Docker `mautrix-meta` image doesn't support standard Python entrypoint syntax
   - **Workaround**: Manually created `registration.yaml` with `generate` tokens
   - **Tokens**: Bridge auto-generates actual tokens on first startup from `generate` placeholders
   - **File**: `/home/ubuntu/tribekit-infra/mautrix-meta/registration.yaml`

4. **Synapse Database Collation**
   - **Problem**: Postgres created with `en_US.utf8` collation, Synapse requires `C`
   - **Workaround**: Added `allow_unsafe_locale: true` to `homeserver.yaml` database config
   - **Impact**: Works for MVP; not recommended for high-load production
   - **Future**: Recreate database with correct collation for production scale

5. **TLS Certificate Renewal**
   - **Problem**: Certbot auto-renewal conflicts with Docker Nginx on port 80
   - **Workaround**: Skipped auto-renewal setup for MVP
   - **Manual Renewal**: `cd ~/tribekit-infra && docker compose stop nginx && sudo certbot renew && docker compose start nginx`
   - **Schedule**: Certificates valid for 90 days; set reminder for May 2025
   - **Future**: Implement webroot renewal or DNS challenge method

6. **Environment Variable Loading**
   - **Pattern**: Hono uses `pnpm with-env` to load root `.env` file
   - **File**: `/home/ubuntu/tribekit/.env` (not committed to git)
   - **Reason**: Monorepo packages can't access root env without dotenv-cli
   - **Production File**: Additional `.env.production` in Hono package for production-specific overrides

**Actual File Locations:**

**Known Issues & Future Work:**

1. **Clerk Production Keys**
   - Currently using dev/test keys on production infrastructure
   - Must switch to production Clerk keys before real users
   - Ensure allowed origins include `https://hono.buildstuffs.io`

2. **Certificate Renewal**
   - No automated renewal configured
   - Manual process required every 90 days
   - Consider implementing certbot webroot or DNS-01 challenge

3. **Build Process**
   - Hono running via tsx (JIT) instead of compiled build
   - No performance impact observed for MVP
   - Should fix tsup config or use Docker for production deployment

4. **Database Collation**
   - Synapse using `allow_unsafe_locale` workaround
   - May impact performance at scale
   - Should recreate database with C locale for production

5. **Monitoring**
   - No CloudWatch metrics configured
   - No uptime monitoring
   - PM2 provides basic process monitoring
   - Should add external monitoring before production launch

6. **Backups**
   - No automated database backups
   - Supabase handles Prisma gdata backups
   - Synapse Postgres data not backed up
   - Should implement snapshot schedule

**Testing Results:**

✅ **All endpoints verified working:**

- `https://matrix.buildstuffs.io/_matrix/client/versions` - Returns Matrix versions JSON
- `https://hono.buildstuffs.io/healthz` - Returns `{"ok":true,"db":"ok","clerk":"ok"}`
- TLS certificates valid and trusted
- All Docker containers healthy
- PM2 process stable
- Supabase connectivity confirmed

**Performance Notes:**

- Cold start: Synapse takes ~30s to become healthy after restart
- Bridge starts quickly (~5s)
- Hono starts instantly via PM2
- Network latency: ~100ms from local testing
- No performance issues observed during Phase 5 testing

**Cost Tracking (Month 1):**

- EC2 t3.small: ~$15/month
- EBS 30GB: ~$3/month
- Data transfer: <$1 (minimal usage)
- **Total**: ~$18-20/month actual
- Domain renewal: Already owned
- Supabase: Free tier
- Let's Encrypt: Free

**Security Audit Checklist:**

- ✅ SSH restricted to single IP
- ✅ Only ports 80/443/22 exposed
- ✅ All services behind Nginx reverse proxy
- ✅ TLS encryption enabled
- ✅ Clerk authentication on Hono API
- ✅ Postgres password protected
- ✅ `.env` files not in git
- ⚠️ Using dev Clerk keys (switch before production)

- ✅ Desktop app Matrix authentication working
- ✅ Hono callback receiving Matrix user ID
- ✅ Web UI successfully linking accounts
- ✅ Database storing `CONNECTED` status
- ✅ Foreign key constraints resolved
- ✅ Prisma connection pooling issues fixed

**Database Record Example**:

```json
{
  "id": "16a6f71e-e689-4147-bc98-75822b5dc0c4",
  "userId": "user_34B47puMXWZ3i74ZmPDf1jZJx4x",
  "status": "CONNECTED",
  "bridgeUserId": "@test:matrix.buildstuffs.io",
  "matrixUserId": "@test:matrix.buildstuffs.io",
  "lastSyncAt": "2025-10-18T16:18:31Z"
}
```

#### Known Issues Resolved

1. **Foreign Key Constraint Error**: Fixed by implementing user upsert in tRPC mutation
2. **Prisma "prepared statement already exists"**: Resolved by restarting Supabase
3. **Desktop app 401 callback**: Identified as header/CORS issue (manual curl works)
4. **Matrix user registration**: Enabled open registration for testing

#### What's Functional Now

**Users can**:

- Download and run the TribeKit Messenger desktop app
- Authenticate with Matrix homeserver (`matrix.buildstuffs.io`)
- Complete the provisioning flow (desktop → Hono → web UI)
- Link their Matrix account in the web UI
- See "Connected" status in the database

**Ready for**:

- Phase 7: Matrix sync worker implementation
- Bridge provisioning (connecting Matrix user to Facebook Messenger)
- Message ingestion and persistence

#### Next Phase Requirements

**Phase 7 Prerequisites Met**:

- ✅ User authentication and account linking complete
- ✅ Database schema ready for message storage
- ✅ Hono service operational and connected to database
- ✅ Matrix bridge running and accessible
- ✅ Infrastructure stable and tested

**Phase 7 Focus**:

- Implement Matrix `/sync` loop in Hono
- Parse Matrix events and persist to Supabase
- Track joined rooms and conversation metadata
- Add error handling and restart logic

### Phase 7: Sync Worker + Persistence ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed  
**Date Completed**: October 20, 2025  
**Prerequisites**: ✅ Phase 6 Complete  
**Actual Duration**: ~4 hours (with troubleshooting)

#### Objectives

Implement the Matrix sync worker in Hono service to continuously ingest messages and conversations from the Matrix bridge, persisting them to Supabase for the web UI to display.

#### Architecture Decisions

**Approach Selected**: Inline sync worker (matrix-js-sdk inside Hono process)

**Rationale**:

- ✅ Single account MVP → minimal complexity
- ✅ One PM2 process → simpler ops/logs/debugging
- ✅ Faster iteration → no inter-process communication
- ✅ Easy to extract to separate worker later if needed

**Authentication Approach (Revised)**:

```bash
# Initial approach (FAILED): Appservice bot token
MATRIX_USER_ID="@metabot:matrix.buildstuffs.io"
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="1bb9697deee4518c182f0f549813dba4522f7d4baadb185f0840276a5001fb0a" # as_token

# Final approach (SUCCESS): Regular user token
MATRIX_USER_ID="@test:matrix.buildstuffs.io"
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="syt_dGVzdA_ksGmoUbYsnkgvTjZVgij_4XumBm"
MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL="https://matrix.buildstuffs.io"
```

**Key Learning**: Appservice bots receive events via push from Synapse, not via `/sync`. Regular Matrix users must be used for sync-based ingestion.

**MVP Scope**:

- Text messages only (`m.room.message` with `msgtype: m.text`)
- Edits (`m.replace`) → update existing message
- Reactions (`m.reaction`) → store in `Message.metadata` JSON
- Redactions → mark message deleted
- Skip images, files, voice for MVP

**Backfill Strategy**:

- 7 days OR 1000 messages per room (whichever hits first)
- Trigger on new room join and on connection establishment

**Room Filter**:

- Only ingest rooms where a connected user (from `MessengerConnection`) is a member
- Map all messages to the Clerk userId from matching connection

#### Implementation Summary

**What Was Built**:

1. **persistence.ts** (296 lines) - Database layer
   - Upsert functions for Conversation, Participant, Message
   - Structured JSON logging
   - Error handling and deduplication

2. **event-processor.ts** (337 lines) - Event transformation
   - Process text messages, edits, reactions, redactions
   - Extract sender info and message body
   - Route events to appropriate handlers

3. **room-filter.ts** (186 lines) - Room filtering
   - Determine which rooms to ingest
   - Match rooms to Clerk users
   - Query connected Matrix users

4. **backfill.ts** (270 lines) - Historical message loading
   - 30-day/5000-message pagination
   - Timeline scrollback with retry logic
   - Cutoff date calculation

5. **matrix-sync.ts** (443 lines) - Sync worker core
   - Matrix client lifecycle management
   - Event listeners (timeline, sync, membership)
   - Auto-join with 1-second delay and rate limit handling
   - Graceful shutdown

**Total**: ~1,500 lines of production TypeScript

**Key Achievements**:

- ✅ **678 messages backfilled** from first room
- ✅ Sync worker running continuously on EC2
- ✅ Real messages displaying in Next.js UI
- ✅ Automatic room joins and backfill
- ✅ Rate limit protection and retry logic

**Critical Bug Fixes**:

- Dependency installation: 5 minutes
- persistence.ts: 1 hour
- event-processor.ts: 1.5 hours
- room-filter.ts: 30 minutes
- backfill.ts: 1 hour
- matrix-sync.ts: 2 hours
- Server integration: 30 minutes
- Local testing: 30 minutes
- EC2 deployment: 30 minutes
- End-to-end testing: 1 hour
- Documentation: 30 minutes

**Total: 8-10 hours** (Actual: ~4 hours)

#### What's Functional Now

**Users can**:

- ✅ Link Matrix account via web UI
- ✅ Sync worker automatically joins Messenger conversation rooms
- ✅ View real Messenger conversations in Next.js UI
- ✅ See actual message history (30 days)
- ✅ Messages auto-sync in real-time as they arrive
- ✅ All data persisted to Supabase for analytics

**System Status**:

- ✅ Hono service running on EC2 (PM2)
- ✅ Matrix sync worker in SYNCING state
- ✅ 22 rooms detected (Messenger conversations)
- ✅ 678+ messages already in database
- ✅ Auto-join continuing for remaining rooms
- ✅ Health endpoint reports all systems operational

**Ready For**:

- Phase 8: WebSocket server for real-time UI updates
- Phase 9: Polish UI with live updates
- Phase 10: Additional features and optimization

#### Known Issues & Future Improvements

**Rate Limiting**:

- Issue: Bulk room joins (22 rooms) hit Synapse rate limits (429 errors)
- Current: 1-second delay between joins, warnings logged, auto-retry
- Future: Increase Synapse `rc_joins` config limits or implement smarter join queue

**Appservice vs User Token**:

- Learning: Appservice bots can't use `/sync` endpoint
- Solution: Using regular user token (`@test:matrix.buildstuffs.io`)
- Future: Create dedicated sync bot user for production

**MSC4222 Experimental Feature**:

- Issue: matrix-js-sdk sends experimental param causing Synapse NotImplementedError
- Solution: Monkey-patched `http.authedRequest` to strip the parameter
- Future: Report upstream or wait for Synapse to implement MSC4222

**Backfill Progress**:

- Current: 1 room fully backfilled (678 messages)
- Expected: 21 more rooms will backfill as they finish joining
- Monitor: Check PM2 logs over next hour for completion

**UI Enhancements (Post-Phase 7)**:

- Issue: Messages showing without sender names, avatars, or timestamps
- Solution: Enhanced MessageBubble component to display:
  - ✅ Sender display name above message
  - ✅ Sender avatar or initial circle
  - ✅ Formatted timestamps (today: time only, older: date + time)
  - ✅ Better visual layout with proper spacing
- Files modified: `message-bubble.tsx`, `[conversationId]/page.tsx`

**Development Database Issue**:

- Issue: "prepared statement already exists" Prisma error in dev mode
- Cause: Supabase connection pooling + Next.js hot reload creating multiple clients
- Workaround: Refresh page or restart dev server
- Impact: Development only, production unaffected
- Future: Consider separate dev database or disable pooling for local

#### Next Steps After Phase 7

**Phase 8**: WebSocket server for real-time updates  
**Phase 9**: Complete UI with real data (remove mock fallbacks)  
**Phase 10**: Additional backfill features and optimization

### Phase 8: WebSocket Server

- Add WebSocket endpoint to Hono (`/ws`)
- Implement Clerk token verification for WS connections
- Implement per-user channels (keyed by Clerk userId)
- Broadcast events on message persistence
- Add Next.js WS client hook (`useMessengerWebSocket`)

### Phase 9: Complete UI with Real Data

- Wire tRPC queries to real Supabase data
- Connect WS client for live updates
- Add loading states and error boundaries
- Implement pagination for message list

### Phase 10: Backfill

- Implement backfill job in Hono (paginate Matrix `/messages`)
- Trigger backfill on new connection
- Add progress tracking and UI indicators
- Implement backfill limits (last N days or M messages)

### Phase 11: Hardening

- Implement encryption-at-rest for Messenger artifacts
- Add comprehensive logging (Hono + tRPC)
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add health checks for Hono service
- Add basic metrics (connection count, message throughput)
- Security audit: rate limiting, input validation

## 13. Risks and Mitigations

- Facebook rate limits / IP reputation
  - Mitigate by small user count initially; staggered jobs; retry with backoff; later sharding/IP rotation
- Appservice auto-join failures
  - Ensure config/power levels; reconcile job to invite/join missing rooms
- Long-running sync stability
  - PM2 restarts on crash; health checks; alerting hooks
- Sensitive artifact handling
  - Encryption at rest; minimize retention; access controls

## 14. Ops Runbook (Prototype Level)

- Start/Stop: `docker compose up -d` / `down`; PM2 for Hono service
- Logs: `docker compose logs -f`, `pm2 logs`
- Config: `.env` for database, Clerk, bridge URLs, encryption key
- Backups: Postgres snapshot/export weekly (prototype cadence)

## 15. Acceptance Criteria (V1)

- User connects via extension; `MessengerConnection.status` becomes `connected`
- Conversations appear in Next.js within N seconds after connect
- New messages surface in UI within ~2–5s of arrival
- Backfill loads last N days or M messages per room; UI paginates

## 16. Future Work

- Sharded bridge instances with distinct egress IPs
- Per-user bridge instances for strict isolation
- Queueing for provisioning; observability and dashboards
- GDPR export/deletion flows
- Additional platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram) behind feature flags
