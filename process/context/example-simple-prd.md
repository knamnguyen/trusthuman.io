# Duma Neobrutalist Redesign - Plan

**Date:** 26-11-25  
**Complexity:** Simple  
**Status:** ⏳ PLANNED

## Overview

Rebuild the Duma social activity discovery app with identical features and mock data, but redesigned with a neobrutalist + Gumroad minimalist aesthetic (rounded, easy on the eyes, modern, friendly, creative, cool). Update tech stack to pnpm, Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS 4, and latest React Router + React Query patterns.

## Execution Brief

### Phase 1: Project Setup
**What happens:** Initialize Next.js with pnpm, upgrade to Tailwind CSS 4, install dependencies (React Query, shadcn/ui, lucide-react).

**Test:** `pnpm dev` runs without errors, Tailwind classes work.

### Phase 2: Design System
**What happens:** Create neobrutalist color palette, CSS variables, typography scale in `globals.css`.

**Test:** Sample component renders with bold borders, rounded corners, playful colors.

### Phase 3: Data Layer
**What happens:** Create `lib/mockData.ts` with all interfaces and mock data, set up React Query provider.

**Test:** Custom hooks return mock data correctly.

### Phase 4: Core Components
**What happens:** Build neobrutalist-styled UI components (Button, Card, Badge, Avatar, Drawer), Bottom Navigation, tab routing.

**Test:** Components render with correct styling, navigation switches tabs.

### Phase 5: Feature Implementation
**What happens:** Build SwipeFeed, ActivityCard, Drawers, MyActivities, HostedActivities, Profile, Chat components.

**Test:** All 9 features work, mock data displays, animations smooth.

### Expected Outcome
- Fully functional Duma clone with neobrutalist design
- All mock data rendering correctly
- Smooth navigation and animations
- No console errors

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Tailwind CSS 4 compatibility issues with Next.js
- **Mitigation:** Use official Next.js + Tailwind CSS 4 documentation, test configuration early

**Risk 2:** React Router conflicts with Next.js App Router
- **Mitigation:** Use client-side state for tab navigation instead of React Router, or use Next.js built-in routing for pages if needed

**Risk 3:** React Query setup with Next.js App Router
- **Mitigation:** Follow latest React Query + Next.js App Router patterns from official docs, use proper provider setup

**Risk 4:** Neobrutalist design not matching vision
- **Mitigation:** Create design tokens early, test components incrementally, reference Gumroad/neobrutalist examples

**Risk 5:** Data migration errors
- **Mitigation:** Copy mock data carefully, verify all interfaces match, test data access early

## Integration Notes

- **Next.js App Router:** Use `app/` directory structure, server/client components appropriately
- **React Query:** Set up QueryClientProvider in root layout, use hooks for data fetching
- **Tab Navigation:** Use client-side state (useState) for tab switching, not React Router (since it's a single-page app with tabs)
- **Tailwind CSS 4:** Use CSS-based configuration with `@import` and `@config` directives
- **shadcn/ui:** Install components as needed, customize for neobrutalist style
- **Mock Data:** Keep all data in `lib/mockData.ts`, import where needed
- **TypeScript:** Maintain strict typing throughout, use interfaces from mockData
