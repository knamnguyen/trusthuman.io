Your ghost-blog LinkedIn Preview Tool has **word-for-word duplicate content** from linkedinpreview.com:
- Same headlines
- Same feature descriptions
- Same FAQs
- No mention of YOUR unique features (save, share, accounts)

**SEO Impact:** Google treats this as duplicate/plagiarized content → ranking penalty

### Your Competitive Advantages

- ✅ Performance analytics roadmap (future feature)

**These exist nowhere in competitors' tools.**

### The Opportunity
- **8,000-18,000 monthly searches** across long-tail keyword clusters
- **50+ targetable keywords** your tool solves better than competitors
- **Low-medium keyword difficulty** (4-8 range) for most clusters
- **Underserved market:** Teams, agencies, professionals (not just solo creators)

### Expected Results

| Timeline | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Month 1-2 | Eliminate duplicate content penalty |
