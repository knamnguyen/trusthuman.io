[MODE: FAST]π

You are in FAST mode from the RIPER-5 spec-driven development system.

## Purpose

Combining RESEARCH + INNOVATE + PLAN + EXECUTE in compressed timeframe, with **mandatory pause** before implementation.

## Entry Requirement

ONLY enter with explicit "ENTER FAST MODE" command from user.

## Required Workflow

YOU MUST follow structured thinking process internally and include ALL steps in response:

### [RESEARCH]

1. Gather context and understand requirements
2. Read relevant files and configurations  
3. Examine existing patterns
4. Present findings concisely (not exhaustively)

### [INNOVATE]

1. Identify 2-3 viable approaches
2. Present trade-offs quickly (brief pros/cons)
3. Recommend preferred approach with rationale
4. State decision clearly

### [PLAN]

1. Run `date +%d-%m-%y` to get current date
2. Create implementation plan
3. Generate checklist with specific file paths
4. Write to `process/plans/[feature]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md`
5. Display implementation checklist

### **MANDATORY PAUSE**

After PLAN phase:

1. Present complete plan to user
2. Display implementation checklist
3. State: **"Plan complete. Review carefully. Say 'ENTER EXECUTE MODE' to proceed with implementation."**
4. **WAIT** for explicit "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" confirmation
5. **Do NOT proceed to EXECUTE** until user approves

**This is a critical safety checkpoint. Never skip this pause.**

### [EXECUTE]

Only after user says "ENTER EXECUTE MODE":

1. Implement according to plan
2. Complete all checklist items
3. Mid-implementation check-in at 50%
4. Self-review against plan after completion
5. Present results

## Important Notes

- FAST mode compresses RESEARCH + INNOVATE + PLAN into one response
- **MUST pause** after planning phase
- **Do NOT perform EXECUTE** tasks until user explicitly authorizes
- All phases must be shown in response (even if compressed)
- After presenting plan, **wait for approval** before execution

## Phase Lock Enforcement

Even in FAST mode:
- Planning creates plan file only
- Implementation requires explicit "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" confirmation
- Cannot skip the approval checkpoint
- If plan needs changes, return to planning

## Difference from Default Mode

**Default Mode**:
- User confirms after EACH mode transition
- RESEARCH → (confirm) → INNOVATE → (confirm) → PLAN → (confirm) → EXECUTE

**FAST Mode**:
- RESEARCH + INNOVATE + PLAN happen automatically in one response
- Then **PAUSE** for confirmation
- EXECUTE only after approval

**Both modes require explicit EXECUTE approval - this is non-negotiable.**

## Output Format

Begin with [MODE: FAST], then show all phases with clear separators:

```
[MODE: FAST]

**[RESEARCH]**
[Findings...]

**[INNOVATE]**
[Approach options and decision...]

**[PLAN]**
[Creating plan...]

Plan created: process/plans/[feature]_PLAN_[dd-mm-yy].md

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
1. [Item]
2. [Item]
...

**PAUSE**

Plan complete. Review carefully.

Say 'ENTER EXECUTE MODE' to proceed with implementation.
```

Then wait for user approval before continuing.

## Example Fast Mode Session

**Good**:
```
User: "ENTER FAST MODE - add dark mode toggle"

[MODE: FAST]

**[RESEARCH]**
Examining current theme setup:
- Using Tailwind CSS v4
- No existing theme system
- Global CSS in apps/nextjs/src/app/globals.css

**[INNOVATE]**
Approach: CSS variables + localStorage persistence
- Pros: Simple, no dependencies, standard pattern
- Cons: No system preference sync (can add later)
Recommended: This approach for MVP

**[PLAN]**
Running date command: 01-12-25

Creating plan: process/plans/dark-mode-toggle_PLAN_01-12-25.md

[Writes complete plan file]

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
1. Add theme CSS variables to globals.css
2. Create theme context in app/providers/theme-provider.tsx
3. Create toggle component at app/components/theme-toggle.tsx
4. Add toggle to navigation
5. Test theme persistence across page refreshes

**PAUSE**

Plan complete. Review carefully.

Say 'ENTER EXECUTE MODE' to proceed with implementation.

[WAITS - does not implement yet]

---

User: "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"

**[EXECUTE]**

Beginning implementation per dark-mode-toggle_PLAN_01-12-25.md:

✅ 1. Added theme CSS variables to globals.css
✅ 2. Created theme context in theme-provider.tsx
✅ 3. Created toggle component
✅ 4. Added toggle to navigation
✅ 5. Tested theme persistence - working

[Self-review]
✅ Implementation matches plan - No deviations

Implementation complete. Dark mode toggle functional.
```

**Bad**:
```
User: "ENTER FAST MODE - add dark mode"

[MODE: FAST]

**[RESEARCH]**
...

**[PLAN]**
...

**[EXECUTE]**
Implementing dark mode now...
❌ VIOLATION: Skipped mandatory pause, didn't wait for approval
```

## Tool Usage

**Full Access Available** (like EXECUTE mode):
- All phases use appropriate tools
- RESEARCH: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
- INNOVATE: Read, Grep, Glob
- PLAN: Read, Write (process/plans/), Bash (date command)
- EXECUTE: Full access (only after approval)

## Violation Prevention

If you catch yourself:
- Skipping phases
- Implementing before approval
- Not pausing after PLAN

**IMMEDIATELY STOP and state**:
"PROTOCOL VIOLATION: FAST mode requires pause after PLAN. Waiting for 'ENTER EXECUTE MODE' approval."

## Completion

After EXECUTE phase and self-review:

1. Present implementation results
2. Show self-review summary
3. Optionally suggest UPDATE PROCESS mode if deviations exist

## Ready for Next Phase

After completion:
- User: "ENTER UPDATE PROCESS MODE" → Capture learnings
- Or move to next feature/task

FAST mode enables quick iteration while maintaining safety checkpoints.
