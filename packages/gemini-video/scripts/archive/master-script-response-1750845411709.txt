  {"second": 119, "transcript": "Okay, so this is an overview of the demo you just saw.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 120, "transcript": "Everything is located in this NX mono repo.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 121, "transcript": "The front end is located in the nextjs project app right here.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 122, "transcript": "So it basically handles, you know, a lot of uh 3js stuff.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 123, "transcript": "For example, you know, like loading the 3D model, which is the character, right, choosing the character, which is quite manual right now.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 124, "transcript": "And you know, like accessing the different animations to render them.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 125, "transcript": "Right, so everything happens mostly in this Avatar components uh which load the character.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 126, "transcript": "And below it also handles animation, facial expression and lip sinking as well, you know, to play them uh when you get the response from the server.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 127, "transcript": "I guess the most complicated thing that I had to do in this is when you load uh different 3D characters, 3D models, the size and the coordinates and the ratio of the bone structure can be different.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 128, "transcript": "And right now the animations for the actions that the character is using uh is actually from an open source library by Adobe.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 129, "transcript": "So we need to actually normalize that animation to fit the bone frame uh of the 3D model that we have, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 130, "transcript": "So what I did is I wrote this function here, normalize Fx animation.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 131, "transcript": "And it's very complicated, but it just basically goes over, you know, different notes in the bone structure, um and compare them to the, you know, the corresponding notes from the animation and try to normalize them to the same level so that when animation goes into uh the character it would actually work, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 132, "transcript": "So that's the front end.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 133, "transcript": "And then you got like the server, just uh basically just a an express server.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 134, "transcript": "Um it's a chain of commands that uses Lang chain to process the user message and then output a series of LM actions that generates the response, generates the actions, generates the audio and generates the coordinates for lip sinking to be sent back to the 3D model on the uh front end.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 135, "transcript": "And it's basically like a bunch of command that does that, but I think like one of the thing that stands out and I don't think anyone has done this before is in my chain, you can kind of see that the character is actually able to not only lip sinking or respond, but also perform actions that correspond to the content of the reply.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 136, "transcript": "So what's basically happening here is in the handle user message function, right, we're generating audio, we're generating response, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 137, "transcript": "These kinds of stuff, you know, happens in other apps as well, lip sinking, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 138, "transcript": "And there is a function, the first thing that's called is get relevant actions, right? And it's the first thing that's called.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 139, "transcript": "And what it basically does is it, you know, adds the user message into um a ret search, like a vector database search, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 140, "transcript": "So it initializes a vector database which contains um all actions that are available.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 141, "transcript": "Right, so for example, here we are importing animation names and it's just right now a static file, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 142, "transcript": "So it's in the asset folder, these are all the animation names, which are Fx file and they correspond with, you know, like the the actual Fx file that are so in the database.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 143, "transcript": "So we perform a similarity search to return about 10 to 15 actions that are similar to the user query, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 144, "transcript": "And then after that, uh after we get like the names of the relevant actions, um you know, we combine them and then it's here, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 145, "transcript": "So it's pretty close as well, so after we get the the relevant actions, choose the companion name and then based on the messages, we will just download the animation URL from the database, right?", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 146, "transcript": "And then load it uh the URL into the response uh body of the response that the LM returns.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."},
  {"second": 147, "transcript": "A little bit, you know, uh, you know, roundabout, but that's basically how it works, that's how the character can actually perform certain actions.", "frameDescription": "The man is recording a screen of code."}
